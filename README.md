# Adult Income Prediction (Logistic Regression + Flask)

This project is a **web-based machine learning application** that predicts whether an individual's annual income is **more than $50K** or **less/equal to $50K**, using a **Logistic Regression** model trained on the **Adult Income (Census) dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The app provides a user-friendly form with both **numeric fields** and **radio buttons** for categorical data, making it intuitive for non-technical users.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Logistic Regression model trained on curated, important features
- Tidy and clear input interface:
  - Numeric inputs for quantitative values
  - Radio buttons for categorical choices
- Outputs income prediction category with a **confidence score**
- Responsive and minimalistic Flask-based frontend

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Adult Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
- **Rows:** 48,842
- **Target:**  
  - **1** â†’ Income > $50K  
  - **0** â†’ Income â‰¤ $50K  

**Features used in the model:**
1. **Age** â€“ Numeric (e.g., 37)  
2. **Education Number** â€“ Numeric representation of education level (e.g., 10)  
3. **Hours Per Week** â€“ Average working hours per week (e.g., 40)  
4. **Capital Gain** â€“ Annual capital gain from investments/assets (e.g., 0)  
5. **Sex** â€“ Radio option: Male / Female  
6. **Marital Status** â€“ Radio option: Married-civ-spouse / Other

## ðŸ–¥ Prediction Output
The model predicts:
- **">50K Income"** â€“ Likely earning over $50K annually  
- **"<=50K Income"** â€“ Likely earning $50K or less annually  
- Displays **Confidence %** alongside the prediction
