# Logistic-Regression
Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems, especially binary classification. It models the probability that input data belongs to a certain class by using a logistic (sigmoid) function, which converts input features into an output value between 0 and 1, interpreted as probability.
